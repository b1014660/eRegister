eRegister
=========

An electronic attendance register 

The puprose of the project is to create an electronic register for attendance and this will be achieved using Grails and
Github by a Sheffield Hallam University student. The application is part of a the second assignement for the Web
Architecture module. For the assignment I was asked to set up an online registration system using Github and Grails. 
The system should be used by admin staff for keeping data on students and staff.  The data recorded will include 
students, instructors, course, enrolment, registration class, registration entry and registration sheet and all can 
be accessed online digitally. 

In the module and this application I am exploring MVC and focusing on domain modelling to achieve the "Web Based Class
Register".
