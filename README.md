An electronic attendance register 

The puprose of the project is to create an electronic register for attendance and this will be achieved using Grails and
Github by a Sheffield Hallam University student. The application is part of a the second assignment for the Web
Architecture module. For the assignment, I was asked to set up an online registration system using Github and Grails. 
The system should be used by admin staff for keeping data on students and staff.  The data recorded will include 
students, instructors, course, enrolment, registration class, registration entry and registration sheet and all can 
be accessed online digitally. 

In the module and this application I am exploring MVC and focusing on domain modelling to achieve a high quality 
"Web Based Class Register". The domain modelling and mappings within the classes were based on an Entity Relationship
Diagram handed to me at the start of the semester. The database is run on MySQL and is command driven via the terminal. 

Installation:

To access the application, Grails 2.1 must be installed and it would be beneficial to run it on a Linux operating system
as this is the one I have used.

To get the application via the terminal, cloning code can be used: 
First, open the terminal, type the code in to download it, then go into the app, run the browser and go to the local host. 

git clone git@github.com:b1014660 /eRegister.git

Alternatively clone from windows http://windows.github.com/
